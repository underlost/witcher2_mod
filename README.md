## Witcher 2 Mod files

This is mainly for my own personal archival purposes, but should be easy enough for anyone to use.

### What is this?

These are my mod files for Witcher 2. In short, it activates a sort of 'god mode' and instant kills for Geralt. This goes for boss fights and even applies to some of the mini games like the pub brawls. Tested on multiple playthroughs and wont cause any game breaking bugs or glitches. Ive also attached a modified item price table to reduce costs when buying from merchants.

### Why?

As much as I love the Witcher series, it's a really long game. by the first act, I was a little tired of constantly killing everything in the woods as I ran back and forth. The combat is enjoyable, but I just wanted to experience the story. Steam still has me logged at over 54 hours played. I can only imagine how long that would be if I had legitimately killed everything.

### How to install

Locate your Witcher 2 directory, and in the `CookedPC` folder, place the included files, simple as that. Works for both Win/Mac, and Steam/non-Steam versions.

### Isn't this cheating?

Yes. Deal with it. It's a single player mod and doesn't hurt anyone.
